üßê¬†During the last decades, advances in technology have enabled Education Ministries from around the globe to collect and manage a growing volume of digital information to better understand what drives students' performance, how inequalities correlate with external factors, or what is the general evolution of education levels. However, the amount of collected data poses new challenges to ministries in their ability to process and make effective use of this information.

üéØ¬†This challenge consists of building an efficient data workflow out of large-scale datasets to produce a real-time, interactive dashboard that provides data visualizations and allows the extraction of valuable insights. To achieve so, large, anonymized relational database datasets from the Jordanian Ministry of Education will be provided as input.

‚õë¬†To create the data workflow, participants should be familiar with techniques such as data sampling, multidimensional statistical analysis, AI modelling, or emerging open-source technologies such as data lakes and flat columnar storage format.
